# Horiseon


## description
The Horiseon Marketing website. The HTML and CSS page was refactored to use semantic elements. Alt tags were added to pictures and icons to make sure people with disabilities can access the website using screen readers or braille keyboards. Accessible websites also rank higher in search engines.
